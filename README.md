This is code that was used for data migration purposes during the roll-out of the large European Project of KETHEA.

KETHEA is the largest rehabilitation and social reintegration network in Greece. It has been providing its services to drug addicts and their families since Ithaki, the first Greek therapeutic community, was set up in 1983. Its services are offered free of charge on the street and in prisons and rehabilitation units around Greece. KETHEA also helps people suffering from other forms of addiction including alcohol, gambling and the Internet.

KETHEA programmes are drug-free and offer a comprehensive range of services which seek to help the individual recover and build a new life for themselves in which they participate in society productively and on equal terms. KETHEA provides counselling and drug treatment, family support, health care, education and training, legal support and assistance reintegrating into society and re-entering the world of work. KETHEAâ€™s aims are full and sustained abstinence from substances for the individual and their equitable reintegration into society.

KETHEA also runs school and community-based prevention and early intervention programmes, and is active in training and research in the field of addiction. Its therapeutic programmes and activities seek to raise awareness of the phenomenon, to promote scientific knowledge, and to continually improve the services offered to addicts and their families.
